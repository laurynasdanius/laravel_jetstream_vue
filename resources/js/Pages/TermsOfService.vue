(“Notion,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) provides an all-in-one workspace allowing our users to write, plan, collaborate, and get organized. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and share your personal information and to assist you in exercising the privacy rights available to you.

## **Scope**

This Privacy Policy covers the personal information we collect about you when you use our products or services, or otherwise interact with us, including on our public website at [www.notion.so](http://www.notion.so/) (the "**Website**"), and Notion’s online software-as-service platform including any related APIs provided by Notion, together with all related mobile and desktop applications (collectively, “**Services**”). This policy also explains your choices surrounding how we use your personal information, which include how you can object to certain uses of the information and how you can access and update certain information.

## 1. Personal Information we collect

We collect personal information when you provide it to us, when you use our Website or Services, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below.

**A. Information You Provide to Us**

**Account Creation:** When you create an account or otherwise use the Services, we collect information such as your name, email address, password, role within your team or enterprise, and an optional profile photo.

**Your Communications with Us:** We collect personal information from you such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter, request customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us. We also collect the contents of messages or attachments that you may send to us, as well as other information you choose to provide, and that may be associated with your communications.

**Payment Information:** When you choose to subscribe for Personal, Team, or Enterprise plans on the Services, we will collect payment information allowing you to pay us. We use third-party payment providers to process payments on the Services. We may receive information associated with your payment information, such as billing address and transaction information, but we do not directly store payment information on the Services.

**Surveys:** We may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include personal information.

**Interactive Features:** We may offer interactive features such as forums, blogs, chat and messaging services, and social media pages. We and others who use our Website or Services may collect the information you submit or make available through these interactive features. Any content you provide via the public sections of these features will be considered “public” and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. By using these interactive features, you understand that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for their own purposes.

**Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests:** We may run sweepstakes and contests. Contact information you provide may be used to inform you about the sweepstakes or contest and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes.

**Conferences, Trade Shows, and Other Events:** We may attend conferences, trade shows, and other events where we collect personal information from individuals who interact with or express an interest in the Services.

**Job Applications**. We may post job openings and opportunities on the Website or Services. If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to assess your qualifications.

**B. Information Collected Automatically**

**Automatic Data Collection:** We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with our Website or Services. This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device, location information (including inferred location based off of your IP address), Internet service provider, pages that you visit before, during and after using the Website or Services, information about the links you click, information about how you interact with the Website or Services, including the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use the Website or Services. Information we collect may be associated with accounts and other devices.

**Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information:** We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Website or Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your devices that allow us and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.  For more information regarding these Technologies, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.notion.so/Cookie-Notice-bc186044eed5488a8387a9e94b14e58c).

**Analytics:** We may also use third-party service providers to collect and process analytics and other information on our Website or Services. These third-party service providers may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other storage technology to collect and store analytics and other information. They have their own privacy policies addressing how they use the analytics and other information and we do not have access to, nor control over, third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.  For more information regarding third-party cookies, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.notion.so/Cookie-Notice-bc186044eed5488a8387a9e94b14e58c).

**C. Information from Other Sources**

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations. For example, if you access our Website or Services through a third-party application, such as a social networking site or a third-party login service, we may collect information about you from that third party that you have made available via your privacy settings.

Should you choose to use the Google Contacts feature within our Services, we will have the ability to view your contacts via the Google People API. The sole use of this data is to populate the auto-completion of your contacts when sending invitation emails. Notion will not use this data for any other purpose.
